# CA-UIM---Split-alarm-text-up-for-reorganising
Breaks up text received to allow ordering, only good for static, repeated messages where the text remains the same.

Use case:
An uneditable message that was no longer relevent needed altering.  This could've been achived in an OA escalation rule but the original message includes a problem filename, which is useful in the alert and couldn't be added via AO rule.
